	  <strong>[Penguin Prison - Calling (Elephante Remix)]</strong><br>
		Come calling (calling, calling, calling)<br>
		Come calling (calling, calling, calling)<br>
		There's something I can never say<br>
		It's too complicated and you don't need to know<br>
		I start but then I hestitate<br>
		There's too many people and I can't be alone<br>
		I've got a problem<br>
		I can't decide<br>
		I change my mind about one too many times<br>
		You've got a problem<br>
		I'll tell you why<br>
		There's something else around if you need to<br>
		I'm calling, calling out your name<br>
		Whenever you want me<br>
		I'm calling, calling out your name<br>
		<strong>[MAGIC! - Rude (Zedd Remix)]</strong><br>
		Why you gotta be so rude?<br>
		<strong>[3LAU - How You Love Me (feat. Bright Lights)]</strong><br>
		'Cause I could be the rain in your desert sky<br>
		I could be the fire in your darkest night<br>
		I could be your curse or your angel<br>
		It's all in how you love me<br>
		I could be the rain in your desert sky<br>
		I could be the fire in your darkest night<br>
		I could be your curse or your angel<br>
		It's all in how you love me<br>
		It's how you love me<br>
		<strong>[Imagine Dragons - Demons (Dzeko and Torres Remix)]</strong>	<br>
		When the days are cold<br>
		And the cards all fold<br>
		And the saints we see are all made of gold<br>
		When your dreams all fail<br>
		And the ones we hail are the worst of all<br>
		And the blood's run stale<br>
		Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound<br>	
		This is all for you, don't want to hide the truth<br>
		No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed<br>
		This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come<br>
		This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come<br>
		When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>
		It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide<br>
		Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>
		It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide<br>
		<strong>Melody: [Fedde Le Grand & Nicky Romero - Sparks feat. Matthew Koma (Vicetone Remix)]</strong><br>
		<strong>[Galantis - Runaway (U & I)]</strong><br>
		U, and I I I I I<br>
		U, and I I I I I<br>
		U, and I I I I I<br>
		U, and I I I I I<br>
		<strong>[Cash Cash - Surrender feat. Julia Micheals]</strong><br>
		I was running on an empty heart<br>
		Not a trace of gasoline (gasoline)<br>
		Trying to dim every single spark<br>
		That could hurt, that could burn all of me<br>
		Like a soldier on a battleground<br>
		Lying wounded on the field<br>
		I was fighting along with the broken sword<br>
		Now I'm caught in a war with no shield<br>
		<strong>[Vicetone - Chasing Time feat. Daniel Gidlund]</strong><br>
		If we could drive the words we say<br>
		Every single line could lead the way<br>
		With the speed of light here on our side<br>
		We're chasing time<br>
		Can't afford to lose velocity<br>
		When you're going places you never seen<br>
		With the speed of light here on side<br>
		We're chasing time, chasing time<br>
		<strong>[Bastille - Pompeii (Audien Remix)]</strong><br>
		I was left to my own device<br>
		Many days fell away with nothing to show<br>
		And the walls kept tumbling down<br>
		In the city that we love<br>
		Great clouds roll over the hills<br>
		Bringing darkness from above<br>
		But if you close your eyes,<br>
		<strong>[Mako - Our Story (Exige 'Proximity Mashup 2015' Remix)]</strong><br>
		This is our story that we could take back some day<br>
		Our lonely glory that we could get back they say<br>
		This is our story that we could take back some day<br>
		Our hope if only we coudl take back some day<br>
		<strong>[Tom Swoon & Paris Blohm feat. Hadouken! - Synchronize]</strong><br>
		Round and round our hearts go<br>
		Ticking like a metronome<br>
		Forget it all<br>
		Let it go<br>
		The tempo's of the night's gonna realign<br>
		Everybody synchronize<br></p>
